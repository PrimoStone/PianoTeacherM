Here's a summary of what we did to fix the mobile pitch detection:

Key Solutions:
Fixed sample rate mismatch by getting system capabilities first
Reduced FFT size to 256 for mobile (balanced speed vs accuracy)
Added controlled processing intervals (50ms) to prevent gaps
Optimized smoothing constant (0.4) for faster response on mobile
Performance Improvements:
Removed unnecessary audio processing (echo cancellation, noise suppression)
Simplified the detection pipeline
Implemented more efficient processing loop
Better error handling and logging
The app should now provide:

Consistent pitch detection across devices
Lower latency
More reliable note recognition
Better mobile performance
